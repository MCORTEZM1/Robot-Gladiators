# Robot-Gladiators

Hello world!!! Welcome to my Robot Gladiators README. 

Robot gladiators is a minimum viable product fighting/rpg where the player plays
the role of a battle bot engineer/ coach. 

Throughout the short game, the player will be presented the choice
to fight and bet on a battle, or skip it for a -10 money point (MP) penalty. 

If the player chooses to fight, he will begin battle with the opponent. 
The robot last standing wins the round and the player takes the cash $$$! 

The player will then be able to shop for items in the store, 
to upgrade the robot for future battles. 

Good Luck! Have Fun!!
